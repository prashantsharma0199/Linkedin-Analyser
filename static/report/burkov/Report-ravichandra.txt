I'm wondering who and why decided that to use such expressions in inter-hunan communication is normal? Nobody talks like that with friends or family. On TV they don't speak like that. Why office is a right place for that?

This is the oldest photo of Paris and the first-ever photo of humans. This is a daguerreotype taken in 1839 by Louis Daguerre. The same year the daguerreotype was made commercially available and is therefore generally accepted to be the year of the invention of photography.The photo was taken at the Place de la République, one of the city’s main squares. The streets seem unusually quiet, but this is in fact because the technique used required such a long exposure time, that passing movements were not captured.There are two visible silhouettes. They appear to be a man and a shoe shiner, sat on the edge of the pavement.

E-commerce and other internet-driven businesses were valued at USD $9 trillion in 2019. It's hundreds of millions of workplaces around the globe. All that is only possible because WWW is based on an open standard that allows 1) hosting your business independently and 2) scraping the data. Modern AI is also possible thanks to the Web's openness.You can see what would have happened if Apple and Google were there before WWW. They would establish a closed ecosystem of two app stores where they would dictate who can do what and where it's they who get the biggest part of the pie.I can say without exaggeration is that the possibility of simple data scraping is the foundation of the modern online economy and AI.

Each time you search something in Google, click on a search result, and the target website blocks the content and asks you to subscribe first, know it's cloaking and forbidden by Google for any website that wants to be in Google's index.Feel free to (and I encourage you to do so) report such websites to Google and cite cloaking as the nature of the violation. Use "Send feedback" link at the bottom of the search result page.Letting Google bot crawl the website entirely, and then hiding the information from real people coming from Google, is a fraudulent practice and must be fought against.

Twitter stосk dоwn by 20% following the Trump ban. Telegram has got 25 million new users in three days, including two presidents. The biggest digital migration in history.========This is what will happen (in my opinion). Twitter's biggest reason for discussion is arguments between political or social opponents. When the entire political spectrum (say, both Dеmоcrats and Rеpublicаns) are on Twitter, they actively insult one another in the comments to their tweets. This creates an addiction and a huge money flow for Twitter. If one group leaves Twitter, say Rерublicаns, Dеmоcrаts will no longer have anyone to argue with. The biggest chunk of discussion will stop.As a consequence, over time the remaining users will lose interest in using Twitter (at least as frequently as before) and the money flow will become even smaller. Big influencers will see a decrease in activity and will create accounts elsewhere. It's a chain reaction.Twitter seems to shооt оneself in the fооt.

Many companies look for ways to attract talent. Some traditionally use perks and other bonuses, but, in very competitive markets, bonuses don't work that well anymore. Rare, well educated or gifted talent looks for more: flexible schedule, work from home or from abroad, a possibility of publishing, diversity, social or environmental responsibility of the employer, and more.However, even that is not enough as many companies now declare similar values. If you compete for rare talent and look for creative ideas to attract it, I have one for you.Freedom of speech.Promise your employees that you will fight for their right to speak freely. Both in the physical world and online. Promise that they will not be canceled after they post their opinion online, as long as what they post is not contrary to the law.Promise that what they say or post will not be tied to their position or role in the organization. Promise that what they say or post would remain their personal matter, as long as the law is respected.Promise the freedom of speech and fight for it and for your employees.It's bold. But if you do that, you will get the best talent. At this point, very few employers in the world have the courage to protect the freedom of speech of their employees. Become one of them.

Several people asked me in private about my opinion on the situation with Google and its former employee, an AI ethics researcher, Dr. Timnit Gebru. I understand that the topic is delicate because Google leadership is accused by Dr. Gebru of censorship, racism, and sexism. I know that, in the light of recent events, this topic in America is much more sensitive than in other countries. Many of my followers and connections are Americans, so, to avoid hurting anyone's feelings, will not comment on this part of the story.What I will comment on is the second part: the use of large-scale language models (LLMs) in Google search. LLMs, such as BERT, according to Dr. Gebru (as it follows from her online remarks in my interpretation), are racist and sexist, and should not be used in Google search.In my opinion, an LLM trained on *open domain data* (and this is very important) is a Frankenstein. It's not an analogy, it really is a Frankenstein: each text is a representation of a part of one person's brain at some moment in time. An LLM picks such parts of the brains of a million people and puts them together to form an artificial brain. This artificial brain can generate new texts or make predictions based on its understanding of some input text.More in the comments.

Probably we, at Gartner, have found a good compromise, but I actually prefer remote meetings: in Teams the quality is exceptional, you can quickly discuss an issue with a colleague while sharing the screen. The recording feature is awesome when you cannot be there.I think the problem is not the virtual meetings, but their quantity that some employers cannot keep reasonable. Also, everything has become virtual this year, so people seem to blame meetings even more than before.

We predict the occupation code, industry, difficulty to hire, and average hiring period.We model salaries for job descriptions that don't have them in the text, we normalize locations, job titles, and company names. All that in 16 languages, 23 countries, in real-time.We hire.

As you probably know, I'm disappointed with Spark. I look for a simple distributed computing library for Python that would take full advantage of one big multicore machine. Ideally, I would like it to 1) be easily installable in a virtual machine or a container, 2) be able to detect available CPU cores/RAM and adapt, 3) take a parquet or CSV from S3 as input, 4) apply a sequence of user-defined functions to each record in columns I would specify, and 5) save the result to S3. All in the RAM of one machine or container.Very important: it must work with ALL Python packages I'm able to install on the machine.Any ideas? Would Dask do that? Also, what about Ray? Anything better?

Lots of things in Spark remain manual while they shouldn't. The biggest WTF for me that the developer must think about how to partition the data before the crunching begins and after basically each operation of filter/group by. Why doesn't Spark think about things like that? I understand that some use cases can be very specific, but for most of us, we just want to run some UDFs applied to each row of the dataframe and then do some averaging/grouping.Basically, all Spark tutorials will tell you that before you start crunching you should repartition the data according to the following rule of thumb: num_paritions = num_executors x num_CPU_cores_per_executor x 3. If it's so, why doesn't Spark do that when it can help? If it doesn't help, then why all tutorials say that it does?Programming for Spark is like low-level programming when you have to care about garbage collection yourself after basically each operation. Would you like to do that manually in 2020? I don't think so. Why does Spark what you to do that?I have one hypothesis. Some big data consulting companies have a significant influence on the Spark development. They want Spark to remain low-level and manual and don't want it to work well out of the box for the vast majority of use cases.

After some investigation, it seems that this "neural engine" that comes with the new Macbook Pro doesn't accelerate the training of neural networks, but only accelerates inference. With the limit of 16GB RAM, I don't think that I would switch from my Intel i9 Macbook Pro with 32 GB RAM.

PySpark, a python API for Spark, sucks. Trying to deliver python dependencies to the cluster is hell. Some of them work, some don't work, you have no idea why. The only way to dynamically deliver dependencies to a cluster is to zip them and either pass the zip as a --py-files argument when you run the job or as the argument of the sparkContex.addPyFile() method within the Python code.In both cases, the effect is the same: some dependencies work and some don't. What's the most annoying, Pandas is an integral part of PySpark API. For example, a dataframe in PySpark has a method df.toPandas(). So, how about that: this API doesn't work unless you import Pandas. But you cannot import Pandas if you don't deliver it to the cluster. And you cannot deliver it within a zip file because it's one of those python dependencies that don't work when delivered inside a zip file.I thought I would love Spark but I hate Spark because of PySpark. They would rather not build PySpark. It doesn't attract developers. It turns them off.

So, about a year ago, Google proposed me to get verified. They asked to send my selfie photo as well as a photo of any government-issued ID. I have sent them that. After almost a year-long review, they rejected the verification and requested for one more selfie and one more photo of a government-issued ID.Very funny, Google, but nope.By the way, I have my Gmail account since its release in 2004. It's so full, that I pay a monthly fee for an extra space. What other proof that me it's me they might need?

You probably wondered what happened to my new book that Amazon put on hold because it was created using LaTeX? Here's what happened during the last two weeks.I requested an investigation and they took one week to do that. After one week of "investigation," they just told me that the PDF is not good for printing. So, one week was just lost. I bought Adobe Acrobat Pro and processed the PDF there, by flattening all transparencies and saving the PDF for printing. So, there was nothing else to do. I updated the PDF on the KDP website and requested to remove the hold. Nothing happened.Then I remembered that some of you advised writing to Jeff Bezos. It was my last resort and I did that.Two days later, I was called by a member of the Executive Customer Support on behalf of Jeff Bezos. I explained my situation once again over the phone. I was promised that the solution will be found. Three days later the hold was just removed. So the paperback book is now available, again!***I told you that it wasn't Amazon's position. Someone blatantly incompetent working in the printing department was identified and disarmed. Too bad that to achieve that, I had to lose three weeks of sales and reach out to the CEO.What's next: I will work to make sure that Amazon starts accepting LaTeX.

Spark is a popular distributed cluster-computing framework. It is written in Scala. Spark has APIs for many other languages. For example, PySpark is a popular API for Python. To the question of whether one should know more than one programming language. I argue that yes.Even if PySpark lets you use Python to write Spark data processing jobs, you will not have the same capabilities as if you used native Scala or even another JVM language. Everything will be fine until it's not. Error messages in PySpark are obscure. Often, they only tell you that something is broken but don't tell what.All Scala dependencies will work with Spark, but not all Python dependencies. You will never know that some Python dependency is not compatible with Spark until you get an obscure error that "something in your code is broken." One frequent issue is that all Python objects must be pickable to work with Spark. If some part of your Python object was implemented in C++ and it is not pickable, Spark will not work with that object. If you want to continue with Python, you will have to re-implement those objects yourself or be lucky enough to find a similar pickable implementation.Because most distributed computing happens in a JVM, I recommend learning at least one JVM language.

Counterfeit is a very serious problem on Amazon. My book is a  constant victim of counterfeit. I try hard to make them removed, but they always come back. And they are very creative! For example, I managed to ban them from selling my book as new, but they found a way to sell it as "used in a good state." To make it look like a used book, they even pay someone to highlight random paragraphs with a lead pencil so that it's hard to say that it's a new fake rather than a used book! Creative? Hell yeah!What's worse, they use the Fulfilled by Amazon program to sell their counterfeit. So, basically, Amazon distributes fake for criminals and even puts its brand on each such sale.Be careful when you shop online!

2020 can be officially called the year of offended. You can say anything and someone would get offended. And not just offended, but they will tell you that they are offended and they will bring an army of supporters.For example, say "Good day!" and you will likely hear, "It's good for you! Some people are suffering!" Or, they will say that you imply that that the night is not good? What about all those people who work at night or underground? What about blind people?Or, you can say that you love your job, and they will tell you that so many people have lost their jobs, so you would better keep it for yourself.And forget about jokes. In 2020, you can only joke about rocks. Rocks don't get offended. Wait. Someone lost a relative because of a rock that fell from the roof. No, better don't joke about rocks. In fact, just don't say anything at all.Now you are a nice person.

So, even if the book was already sold hundreds of times and didn’t contain any visible problem, Amazon has put it on hold and requested me to generate the PDF of the book using different software, which I did.

You remember that Amazon unpublished my new book in the paperback format? They didn't tell me the reason for about 10 days. Now you know what the reason was? The PDF of the book was generated using LaTeX. Yes, they say that LaTeX is not good for book publishing. They want me to generate the PDF "using a different PDF producer." Apparently, it doesn't matter what that different PDF producer would be as long as it's not LaTeX.LaTeX is the primary technology used in scientific and technical books. Thousands of books are prepared and released using LaTeX every year. It's a defacto standard for just *any* scientific publication in computer science and in science in general. Amazon says that LaTeX is not good for publishing.I'm sure that this could not be a deliberate policy of the company. Probably an incompetent person has got a high post in the printing division. Organizations, beware of incompetent people. Especially, do not promote incompetent people. Militant incompetence in corporate leadership is the path to failure for any business, and we know dozens of examples of when that happened.

If you still believe in the (false) promises of some car manufacturers that level-5-autonomy self-driving cars (fully autonomous, no driver needed) will soon be delivered, we just need to gather more data, well, the problem is not about data.

This book is a proof that when an author has written a great book, a publisher will always find a way to spoil it. The book was named by its authors "Practical machine learning" but the publisher said that data mining is the thing (it was a buzzword in the past) and the title needs it. "Tools and techniques" for keywords would not hurt either. Today, when people see "data mining" they assume that it's something very old and outdated, no matter how much effort the author puts into keeping the book up to date. Be true to yourself and never listen to an editor who says they know how to "improve your creation." Your art for them is just a way to make money, here and now.

It's annoying that people writing about machine learning and statistics use the word "sample" in the sense of a single training example. For example, they could write "a model takes a sample as input and outputs a prediction." You have no idea, whether the model takes one or several elements as input and how many outputs it yields.A sample is a randomly chosen *collection* of examples from a larger collection. So, a sample is a group of examples, not an individual example. Sample and example cannot be used interchangeably. Doing so in your text makes it very hard to follow and could even make the entire text useless.

When I defended my PhD dissertation in 2010, I wanted to work in the industry in the field of machine learning. I was afraid, however, that it's already too late to get into the field because machine learning was, in my opinion, a well-developed technology: Google was there, scikit-learn was there, Python was there, so I thought that everyone was aware of what machine learning can do, and use it for solving business problems.Today, ten years later, I finally start being right. Some companies indeed use machine learning for solving their business problems.

The PULSE algorithm takes pixelated faces and turns them into high-resolution images. When it takes a pixelized Obama face it outputs a white face. This is an example of bias in AI: the situation when a machine learning model was trained on the data that has a high imbalance of some class (in this case, white people).People, including many scientists, tend to think that AI is right because its impartial and based on data. However, the AI is only right when trained on balanced data. What is balanced and how to ensure the right balance, it's a huge unanswered question.Image: Twitter / @Chicken3ggPULSE on GitHub: https://lnkd.in/efde43e

Unsupervised learning will never output the model you want.With unsupervised learning, you cannot gradually improve anything.Once something changes in your data, you cannot be sure that the new unsupervised model will be consistent with the old one.Don't make an unsupervised model foundational for your business.

To invent something extraordinary or to make something that changes the world, you have to be crazy. No normal people ever accomplished anything great. Being crazy is hard since the whole society rejects you from the very adolescence. It's a hard life, often full of disappointments. So, if you pursue happiness, you would better be normal.But if you can't be normal then accept that you are crazy, and do what you have to do. The 21st century is not the worst time to be crazy. Humanity has seen worse.

I often receive questions from people in my network about what should they learn and master to become a data scientist. While I personally think that the term "data scientist" is very unfortunate and without a clear definition, this is what a good "data scientist" (in my own understanding of the term) has to master:- Data structures (local and distributed)- Data indexing- Data privacy and anonymization- Data lifecycle management- Data transformation (deduplication, handling outliers and missing values, dimensionality reduction)"- Data analysis (experiment design, supervised and unsupervised learning)- Machine learning tools and techniques (feature engineering, regularization, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, and neural networks)- Data and model visualization, infographics- Computer and database programming, numerical optimization- Distributed data processing- Real-time and high-frequency data processing- Linux (my personal bias)A data scientist also has to be a good popularizer of complex ideas. Having a Ph.D. is not a requirement, but a very big plus: it contributes to the popularizing skill and teaches the scientific approach to problem-solving.#datascience #datascientist

If you plan to do your Master's or Ph.D., choose your research advisor carefully. Ask about them his* current and past students, whether he was easily available for them, whether he responded to the requests for reference sent by their employers.My research advisor, when was asked by one of my first employers whether they should hire me, responded: "You will call me back to thank me if you hire him." This is what a great research advisor would do for his students.Unfortunately, not all research advisors are like this. For one of my hires, their research advisor didn't respond to two of my emails with requests for reference. I still hired the candidate, and I'm very happy with my choice. But the research advisor should be ashamed to ignore such requests about their recent alumni. To be available for their present and past students is advisors' direct duty.___________* or her

Twitter is basically an antenna that leases frequencies. One person can rent a frequency and start broadcasting at this frequency.

An indicator that things might be getting back to normal is book sales on Amazon. Once the quarantine (or self-isolation) started to unfold around the world 10 weeks ago, Amazon basically stopped fulfilling book orders. You could still buy a book from Amazon but that option was hard to find on the book's page. A better alternative was to buy from a third-party seller, if, of course, such an alternative was available.Then, after about three weeks of worldwide quarantine, Amazon started to show the option of buying the book from Amazon, but with a warning (in orange) that the book will be shipped in 7 days.Then 7 vas replaced by 4. Then by 3, and now, since yesterday, it's normal 1-2 days shown in green.Of course, it could be an indicator that Amazon adapted to the situation, but I see it as things are getting back to normal.

TL;DR Be very careful with Tesla and your money."Tesla has never earned an annual profit in nearly two decades of existence, yet its shares are valued more than Ford, Chrysler and General Motors combined. This valuation makes Musk's stake in Tesla worth nearly $30 billion despite the company selling just a fraction of the cars sold by its American competitors. Such a high net worth has not diminished Musk's ambition, as he is known for sleeping on production lines and issuing tyrant-like demands of his employees.""Is Tesla engaging in accounting fraud? The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. Musk with fraud in 2018, but that was related to his infamous $420 "funding secured" tweet. If Tesla is cooking the books, it would be the financial scandal of the decade. One interesting tea leaf has been the revolving door of C-suite executives, especially key legal and accounting people, who all left substantial money on the table to quickly get out of Tesla. Some were only there for a matter of weeks. Why would so many people in the accounting and legal departments quickly exit after learning about Tesla's financial and business practices under Musk?"

I don't understand the excitement of the media about work from home being the new trend. Large corporations compete who will leave their employees at home longer; some already decided until the end of 2021.Remote work was a trend in the early 2010s and it failed. Ask Yahoo, IBM, Aetna, Bank of America, Reddit, and many others who recalled their remote workers back to the office in the late 2010s.Remote work is fine for a short period of time, but in the long term for large corporations it's not a viable model.Currently, remote workers are effective because their teams were built in the office, through face-to-face discussions, physical contact between human beings in the office (during meetings and in the cafeteria), and during various informal offsite activities. Your current team members were hired via physical contact and then they were onboarded for many months with a human touch.Remove all that, and your team will become overtime just a bunch of faces you periodically see on your computer screen and don't care much about.

I made a mind map summary of "The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book" by Andriy Burkov about a year ago and totally forgot about it until recently. It's a fantastic book and you should definitely check it out if you haven't had the chance yet. A quick glance at the branches in the mind map helped me remember (almost) all the core topics discussed in the book so it was a great way for me to review the material in a structured manner. Since this is a very popular book—deservedly so—I thought there'd be a good chance there is another fan out there who might enjoy browsing the mind map (perhaps in preparation for interviews, exams, or life in general) so I made it public here:https://lnkd.in/gkMznUkNeedless to say, this is just my personal notes and is not a replacement for the actual book. Think of this more as a hierarchical table of contents that is full of typos, errors, and missing details. link to the book:http://themlbook.com/Also, if you'd like to contribute and improve/edit the mind map send me a message or leave a comment. #machinelearning #datascience #mindmap

As you probably know, I decided to put both Pythion and R examples in my upcoming Machine Learning Engineering book. I'm not very experienced in R, so I decided to ask volunteers to help me with re-writing my Python code in R.My Python code is object-oriented and I received advice to not use OOP in the R version of the code because it would look artificial.There are three reasons I decided to use the OOP paradigm:1. Compatibility with the Python code (otherwise the Python and R versions of the same code would look inconsistent).2. Incapsulation is recommended for the production code.3. R has 3 OOP versions, so I thought it would be instructive for the reader to learn at least one from my book.I need advice. Should I use OOP in R code when the equivalent Python code is OOP or should I keep OOP only for Python?Also, please send me an email at author@mlebook.com if you would like to volunteer in adapting my Python code to R.#python #r #machinelearning

My team works on building AI systems but never in our discussions we say "AI," because it would sound lame. I believe it's the same for most hands-on AI teams. Though in marketing, everyone says "our AI this, our AI that." I think that it's an indicator of too much unsubstantiated hype around the term. If engineers really thought they build an AI they would say it.

A line of prospectors at the Chilkoot Pass during the Gold Rush, US-Canada border, 1898.The Gold Rush took place mostly on the Canadian territory of Yukon, along The Klondike River. Canadian authorities let American prospectors pass, but set up customs posts guarded by mounted police. At customs, the police took the duty and checked that each person had a supply of food for one year (520 kg). To transfer provisions and other luggage through the post, a prospector had to make about 30 ascents.According to estimates, up to 100,000 people tried to reach Klondike between 1897 and 1898, up to 40,000 succeeded, but only about 4,000 managed to make money on gold.The place had a major shortage of supplies. For example, salt was bought for gold sand, 1 ounce of gold for 1 ounce of salt.According to estimates, prospectors spent on travel, supplies, and tools several times more money than the cost of the gold they managed to extract (the cost of labor not included).The main profit was made by shipping companies, Seattle inventory dealers, Canadian customs, guidebook publishers, and others.

Just read in one job posting: "We believe in Agile methodologies."I suspected that Agile was a cult. After all, Agile has a manifesto, multiple "rituals and ceremonies" (they literally call them that) like 4 kinds of meetings that you must do even if you have nothing to discuss (during one meeting everyone must stand!), a high fee to become certified (without exam), principles so vague that they make everything you do agile, and a belief that if Agile doesn't work for you, you just must learn to do Agile properly (better by becoming certified without exam).

The ugly truth is that you might think that putting Word and Excel in your resume in the 21st century is lame and bad taste, but corporate HR still put those in job descriptions. The stupid machines that sort job applications in the decreasing order of similarity with job descriptions will score your application low because it doesn't contain MS Office skills. For a machine, a skill is a skill.

Accidentally discovered this article by Jaime Zornoza about my book. Usually, I don't share Medium but here I couldn't resist:"One of the reasons why I love reading so much is the following: some person (the author of a book) spends a lifetime learning, investigating, and collecting information about a certain topic. Then, he condenses that information for other people in a text document which can be no more than 100 pages sometimes.That is the case of this book. Years of experience in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence world condensed into 100 beautifully written pages. A true gem."Thanks, Jaime.

Email fascinates me by its ability to survive. So many communication ways came and gone during the recent two decades, but the position of email has not been shaken.Artificial Intelligence has not just solved the problem of spam. It allowed accurately grouping messages in threads, detecting the character encoding, it autocompletes sentences we are typing and even offers entire reply options by analyzing the text of the message.Which is why it's so surprising to still see on a typical "Contact us" page so many addresses: info@company.com, support@company.com, press@company.com, sales@company.com and so on.It's especially surprising to see such a variety of addresses on the website of a company that provides AI as a service or product. If you claim to be an expert in AI, classifying incoming messages by topic should be a piece of cake for you.Having separate email addresses is only justified when the address is either personal or confidential. Otherwise, one email address like hello@company.com should be enough.

If you start building your next text analytics or retrieval system based on searching or counting keywords, congratulations: you are still living in the 1980s. Stemming, lemmatization, stop-words, dictionaries, TF-IDF, all that is as relevant today as a stone ax.It's OK to support a keyword-based system that already exists though. After all, there's no guarantee that you will manage to build something better.

The traditional hiring practices are driven by business needs. The business decides where it would like to be in one year, then the corresponding hiring strategy is developed. That approach worked well for plants and factories in the mid-50s of the 20th century. This is also why companies still use the approach of "going where the resources are".Today, however, we live in a completely different world. Technologies became very complex and diverse. The talent also becomes very heterogeneous. Modern companies should constantly adapt their business goals based on the talent available on the market. The best strategy becomes hiring the best talent when you can and then deciding how to leverage the available talent in an optimal way.

Why do I keep hearing everywhere that the future of machine learning is not supervised, it's self-supervised? Self-supervised learning is still supervised. The only difference is that the labeled data (text) was created by millions of people who didn't know they created labeled data. When you write a sentence, you put words in a specific form and order. The choice of the form and the order is implicit labeling. You can learn *something* from such labeled data, but not *everything*. At least not with the math we currently base our state-of-the-art machine learning on.For me, it looks like an attempt to create the next big thing and to use it for pumping millions from venture capitalists who don't give money for deep learning anymore.

Coronavirus outbreak tests how united we actually are as humanity (hint: we fail). Before the crisis, we often heard from politicians and human-right activists that we are all human, each life counts, and it doesn't matter where a person in danger comes from: we have to stay united and help.What do we see today? EU countries forbid selling critical medical equipment to other EU countries. In the US and Canada, governments are criticized for sending help to affected countries during the early days of the crisis.Are we "every man for himself" or are we all human? Did we mean those words we said about unity and solidarity, before the crisis, or they were just words?

This situation with the coronavirus has shown that politicians are generally incapable of making important decisions. Overall, we have got proof that a political system in which the power belongs to charismatic leaders rather than subject matter experts is weak in the face of serious challenges.The decision about the country, be it about investments, healthcare or education, must be taken by scientists either based on data or to gather data, and not by people who look good on camera and can talk on random topics for hours and caring only about how well they will perform during the next elections.

I think the job interview process is not fair: the employer has more rights to ask difficult questions, while the candidate must only ask convenient questions. What if the process was fair?On the question "Why do you want to leave your current employer?" the candidate would ask "Why did the person who freed this place left your organization?"On the question: "What is your current salary?" the candidate would ask "What are the wages of people holding a similar position in your organization?"On the question "What didn't you like the most about your last job?" the candidate would say "What do you hate about your organization?"Do you have other counterquestions?

Everyone talks about the possibility of a global economic crisis, but apparently not many people know what that might mean for an ordinary person.As someone who survived the Soviet Union collapse, here's one example. My dad bought his first car (Lada) just before the collapse for 9,000 rubles and paid in cash. To get that incredible amount of money, my parents asked all our relatives and friends to lend us 3,000 rubles our family missed.Three months later my dad bought my first scooter for 180,000 rubles (this time we borrowed in a bank). At the same time, the friends of our family, those who understood how the economy works, borrowed in all available banks as much as they could borrow, dozens of millions of rubles, and bought real estate.A year later, I bought milk and bread for millions rubles.

Any company is only as good as the people it employs. In great companies, the hiring principle is "we would rather make a mistake and not hire an excellent employee than make a bigger mistake and hire an average one."Great people tend to work with great people and also tend to leave the company that, once great, gradually becomes average.I think that any modern organization must have "The Greatness Department" that makes sure (by using questionaries, interviews, external reviews, and statistics) that the organization not just remains great but its "greatness index" improves year over year.

A classical machine learning model, including neural networks, is notoriously incapable of doing something that it wasn't trained on. However, for at least one modern form of machine learning, namely zero-shot learning, it's not entirely true. Indeed, a model trained in the zero-shotting setting can learn to predict a tiger on a photo even if it was never exposed to images of tigers.While nobody knows how to move towards building thinking and dreaming machines, I believe that zero-shot learning is the most promising direction of research today.

My post from 2016: "We should stop saying "artificial intelligence" when talking about machine learning. Machine Learning, at present, at best approaches a human reflex, so the term "artificial reflex" would be much more appropriate. Currently, scientists have no clue about how to make the machine learn something more than a simple reflex."Nothing changed.

Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin algorithmically generated every possible melody and then released them to the public domain.To determine the finite nature of melodies, Riehl and Rubin developed an algorithm that recorded every possible 8-note, 12-beat melody combo. This used the same basic tactic some hackers use to guess passwords: Churning through every possible combination of notes until none remained. Riehl says this algorithm works at a rate of 300,000 melodies per second (total of  68,000,000,000 melodies).Rubin and Riehl released these melodies using a Creative Commons Zero license, which means they have “no rights reserved.”This is how technology helps society.All of the melodies they've generated, as well as the code for the algorithm that generated them, are available as open-source materials on Github and the datasets are on Internet Archive:

In a speech at a small Methodist college in Japan shortly after leaving the White House in 1981, President Jimmy Carter began his speech with a joke. The interpreter delivered it in Japanese, and the audience erupted in laughter. Impressed with the interpreter's skill, he asked how the interpreter managed to get such a laugh. Eventually, the interpreter admitted that he had said, "President Carter told a funny story. Everyone must laugh."

Dear scientific and engineering bloggers. I recommend you to reconsider the usage of Medium as a blogging platform. If your primary interest is to spread knowledge then you should know that Medium restricts access to the knowledge you share only to those who pay.If your goal is to make money and Medium shares revenue with you then, of course, you have a reason to stay on Medium but, honestly, how much does Medium pay you for your efforts? Is it worth hiding the knowledge behind a paywall and losing opportunities for reputation growth?All modern computer science and especially machine learning and AI research is published in open archives, such as arXiv. All researchers I know and heard of refuse to publish their work if a journal or a conference doesn't allow republishing on arXiv or doesn't host the publications on their own websites.Believe me, I published a bestseller that anyone can read online without registration and any payment. In the modern knowledge and reputation-based economy, sharing is better than hiding.Share the knowledge and you will do as the most progressive people do.

I use Spotify and initially, its recommendations were good but for the last several months they keep recommending me the same songs or the songs that I already had in my playlist and then removed. They also seemingly don't put a higher weight on the music I listened to more recently or listen to more often.Do you know a good music recommendation system where I can enter bands or songs I like a lot and get good recommendations of what I might also like?I don't mind if it takes some time to train it as long as, in the end, its recommendations are very good.

As you probably noticed, in the recent two chapters of the Machine Learning Engineering book, I started to generously add Python and R code. I think that I will continue that way when the code snippet that illustrates an idea doesn't take more than half a page.If you want to contribute the code for the earlier chapters (and to get a special mention in the book) please send the code, both Python and R to author@mlebook.com. Please mention the chapter number and the equation or the algorithm mentioned in the book you want to complete with your code.The conditions for the code are: 1) be readable and 2) not rely on non-mainstream libraries. For Python, the mainstream libraries are scikit-learn, pandas and numpy/scipy. For R, I'm less an expert.For neural networks, I decided to use PyTorch. I'm not sure if anyone programs neural networks in R. Do you know any mainstream NN library for R? Write in the comments.The link to the first six book chapters is in the comments to this post.
