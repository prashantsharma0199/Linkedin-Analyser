Today Flipkart  delivery boy came to deliver my parcel, he told me through his hand gestures that he can't speak or listen so I gave him the OTP through fingers(👆,✌️). After successful delivery I was able to sense the happiness & confidence of that guy  and he gave me a thumbs up with a smile on his face... Lesson- One should never feel weak and should always be confident and have a smile on the face no matter how the life is.Kudos to Flipkart for giving opportunities to them.#happiness #flipkart #positivity #lifelessons #confidence

*DUCK OR EAGLE?*  *It's up to you.* I was at the airport when a taxi driver approached. The first thing I noticed in the taxi was a sentence, then I read:  *- Duck or Eagle?**You decide.* The second thing I noticed was a clean and shiny cab, the driver well dressed, white shirt and pressed pants, with a tie. The taxi driver got out, opened the door for me and said: "I am John, your chauffeur. While I keep your luggage, I would like you to read on this card what my mission is." On the card was written: John's Mission - Take my customers to their destination quickly, safely and economically, offering a friendly environment. I was impressed. The cab's interior was equally clean. John asked me: "Would you like a coffee?" Playing with him I said: "No, I prefer a juice." Immediately he replied: "No problem. I have a thermal with regular juice and also diet, as well as water." He also told me: "If you'd like to read, I have today's paper and some magazines as well." When the race started, John told me: "These are the radio stations I have and this is the repertoire they play." As if that wasn't enough, John asked me if the air conditioning temperature was good. Then he told me the best route to my destination and whether I wanted to talk to him or whether he preferred that I not be interrupted. I asked: "Do you always serve your customers like this?"  "No," he replied. "Not always. Only in the last two years.My first years as a taxi driver I spent most of my time complaining like other taxi drivers.One day I heard a doctor specializing in personal development." He wrote a book called, *'Who You Are Makes a Difference.'* He said: "If you get up in the morning expecting to have a bad day, you will." *Don't be a DUCK!* *Be an EAGLE!**The ducks only make noise and complain, the eagles soar above the group.* I was all the time making noise and complaining. So I decided to change my attitudes and be an eagle. I looked at the other taxis and drivers.Dirty taxis, unfriendly drivers and unhappy customers. I decided to make some changes.Since my customers responded well, I made a few more changes. In my first year as an eagle, I doubled my income.This year, I already quadrupled.You were lucky to take my taxi today. I'm no longer at the taxi stand. My clients make reservations on my cell phone or text them.If I can't answer, I can get a reliable "eagle" taxi driver friend to do the job. John was different. It offered a limousine service in a regular taxi. John, the taxi driver, decided to stop making noise and complain as ducks do and started to fly over the group, as eagles do. It doesn't matter if you work in an office, maintenance, teacher, civil servant, politician, executive, employee or professional or taxi driver!How do you behave?Are you dedicated to making noise and complaining?  Or is it rising above the rest?*Remember: THE DECISION IS YOURS.* #attitude

A developer (GitHub user Marak) deliberately broke thousands of apps by sabotaging his own open-source project. He replaced his own open-source library with an empty one. All the apps that used his project and auto updated to the latest version broke. It’s not clear why he did this, but it seems he was upset the big companies are profiting from his work and he didn’t get paid.Here are a few tips: If you are using an open-source project, lock to a specific version and don’t automatically update a package or pull anything from the internet.Make sure to test and run the build before deploying it.Be careful of spelling mistakes when downloading packages. You may download a malicious look alike package.Perform due diligence about the package.Any more tips? Comment below.￼

Wow! My teenager showed me a hack that blew my mind. He showed me how someone could inject malicious code into a copy-paste from the web. The risk is HUGE. Admins and Developers copy & paste all the time. You think you are copying one thing, but this attack will inject harmful code into your clipboard without you even knowing. So how can you trust that the code you copied from a blog post is the same code you pasted into your project? All it takes is a single line of code injected into the original code you copied to get a back door to your app. I asked him to record this video to help raise awareness. If you like this video, you can follow Harel Friedlander here on LinkedIn.I also wrote a short blog post with a live demo that you can see how it works. https://lnkd.in/gQuY5kCd#informationsecurity #securityawareness #cybersecurity

I have heard that CRED sends out Macbook to new hires along with the offer letter. According to Kunal Shah they can return the macbook if they do not accept the offer letter. This gesture makes people trust the company and the process far more than some BMW bikes and Dubai rewards gigs #BharatPe #Hiring #Greed Not sure about the info but every single person almost 99% to whom the macbook had been sent with the offer letter ended up joining Cred with 0% lost laptops. This is how a culture of loyalty and trust is built.  BharatPe #culture #people #job #dubai #vacation #bmw #bike #cred #macbook

This post is dedicated to that lower middle class guy. ->Hang on there dont worry, one day your dreams will also be fulfilled. To that guy from tier 3 college who wished for 7 digit ctc. -> just work hard consistentlyTo that guy from tier 3 city who never imagined to be equal to the tier 1city kids from top schools. -> hang on and have faith in yourself, you can.To that below average school student who use to be humiliated in the school for being himself/herself-> just hang on! time will change.During my college days I used a phone from infocus worth 5k for an year before its sim slots were damaged. For the next 2 years I used my sisters hand me down(3 years old with cracked screen) android phone. And eventually when I needed a phone to be active on college placement Whatsapp group I bought a Samsung worth 10k. Even after working for last 1 year. I was using the same 3 years old one.  Also, I never bought a laptop in my life it was either office laptop or the one given by college.Today I entered a shop and came out with an iphone 12 and macbook.If I can you can too. Just hang there for a while work hard a bit and you will for sure.I am grateful my parents, my sisters and my partner who made me believe in me.#softwareengineer #motivation
