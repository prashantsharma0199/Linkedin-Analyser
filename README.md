# LinkedIn-Analyser
The project helps a user to do sentiment analysis of someone's profile (let it be Mr. X) in a matter of few minutes. This project will take the username of Mr. X as input and returns a report of how many posts have positive, negative and neutral sentiment value out of all the posts that he had posted. It will also plot a pie chart of the same. The report also consists of individual sentiment analysis of each of the posts.  Additionally, the project will also show a scatter plot between the subjectivity and polarity of the posts. After, the sentiment analysis, persona analysis takes place and tags Mr. X's personality into the big 5 personality trait models on the basis of scanned content.
