*DUCK OR EAGLE?*  *It's up to you.* I was at the airport when a taxi driver approached. The first thing I noticed in the taxi was a sentence, then I read:  *- Duck or Eagle?**You decide.* The second thing I noticed was a clean and shiny cab, the driver well dressed, white shirt and pressed pants, with a tie. The taxi driver got out, opened the door for me and said: "I am John, your chauffeur. While I keep your luggage, I would like you to read on this card what my mission is." On the card was written: John's Mission - Take my customers to their destination quickly, safely and economically, offering a friendly environment. I was impressed. The cab's interior was equally clean. John asked me: "Would you like a coffee?" Playing with him I said: "No, I prefer a juice." Immediately he replied: "No problem. I have a thermal with regular juice and also diet, as well as water." He also told me: "If you'd like to read, I have today's paper and some magazines as well." When the race started, John told me: "These are the radio stations I have and this is the repertoire they play." As if that wasn't enough, John asked me if the air conditioning temperature was good. Then he told me the best route to my destination and whether I wanted to talk to him or whether he preferred that I not be interrupted. I asked: "Do you always serve your customers like this?"  "No," he replied. "Not always. Only in the last two years.My first years as a taxi driver I spent most of my time complaining like other taxi drivers.One day I heard a doctor specializing in personal development." He wrote a book called, *'Who You Are Makes a Difference.'* He said: "If you get up in the morning expecting to have a bad day, you will." *Don't be a DUCK!* *Be an EAGLE!**The ducks only make noise and complain, the eagles soar above the group.* I was all the time making noise and complaining. So I decided to change my attitudes and be an eagle. I looked at the other taxis and drivers.Dirty taxis, unfriendly drivers and unhappy customers. I decided to make some changes.Since my customers responded well, I made a few more changes. In my first year as an eagle, I doubled my income.This year, I already quadrupled.You were lucky to take my taxi today. I'm no longer at the taxi stand. My clients make reservations on my cell phone or text them.If I can't answer, I can get a reliable "eagle" taxi driver friend to do the job. John was different. It offered a limousine service in a regular taxi. John, the taxi driver, decided to stop making noise and complain as ducks do and started to fly over the group, as eagles do. It doesn't matter if you work in an office, maintenance, teacher, civil servant, politician, executive, employee or professional or taxi driver!How do you behave?Are you dedicated to making noise and complaining?  Or is it rising above the rest?*Remember: THE DECISION IS YOURS.* #attitude

A developer (GitHub user Marak) deliberately broke thousands of apps by sabotaging his own open-source project. He replaced his own open-source library with an empty one. All the apps that used his project and auto updated to the latest version broke. It’s not clear why he did this, but it seems he was upset the big companies are profiting from his work and he didn’t get paid.Here are a few tips: If you are using an open-source project, lock to a specific version and don’t automatically update a package or pull anything from the internet.Make sure to test and run the build before deploying it.Be careful of spelling mistakes when downloading packages. You may download a malicious look alike package.Perform due diligence about the package.Any more tips? Comment below.￼

Wow! My teenager showed me a hack that blew my mind. He showed me how someone could inject malicious code into a copy-paste from the web. The risk is HUGE. Admins and Developers copy & paste all the time. You think you are copying one thing, but this attack will inject harmful code into your clipboard without you even knowing. So how can you trust that the code you copied from a blog post is the same code you pasted into your project? All it takes is a single line of code injected into the original code you copied to get a back door to your app. I asked him to record this video to help raise awareness. If you like this video, you can follow Harel Friedlander here on LinkedIn.I also wrote a short blog post with a live demo that you can see how it works. https://lnkd.in/gQuY5kCd#informationsecurity #securityawareness #cybersecurity

This...What sort of voodoo is this?Cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) is a trenchless rehabilitation method used to repair existing pipelines. It is a jointless, seamless pipe lining within an existing pipe. As one of the most widely used rehabilitation methods, CIPP has applications in sewer, water, gas, and chemical pipelines ranging in diameter from 0.1 to 2.8 meters (2–110 inches).The process of CIPP involves inserting and running a felt lining into a preexisting pipe that is the subject of repair. Resin within the liner is then exposed to a curing element to make it attach to the inner walls of the pipe. Once fully cured, the lining now acts as a new pipeline.https://lnkd.in/dEKxDm-N # #pipeline #water #gas #chemical #eddavidson #safedy #thereyahaveit

I Got this little 𝗖𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 at Haris&Co.  from one of our team member a few days ago ❤️And cute leave applications deserve cute replies right?? 😃😎I believe if relationships are to be valued we need to spare our time with them ✊Isn’t it true that some relations fade away only because we had no time to spare and were trapped in a hectic work schedule? 👉 Don't just build a company, Build a culture that's more than the company so that people have more reasons to work with you than just salary! ❤️🥂Agree?

One bad experience can't be  generalize.I corrected some YouTuber Kunal in the comment section and he blocked me on Linkedin.Today he posted a bad experience with ongoing college placement and the person  suggested don't sign up for campus placement.He is misleading students.Juniors, Be careful following any people on Linkedin.The truth is, campus placement is easy than off-campus placement.He said open source cares about youone GSOCER rejected by many companies because fundamentals are missing.It is just one example.So, Balance is very important.#linkedin #experience #people #google #help #healpinghands
If a person is highly proficient in any skill , this does not mean that he can tell you the best resources to learn that skill . Resources do not work that way .If someone can learn very well from one place that does not mean that you can also learn pretty well from that resource . Everybody have different learning patterns , so just do a bit of research and choose your source for learning. #learning #research #work #skillup #skilldevelopment #upskilling
This is so true !😂Recently I was discussing with my family about which company to join and my mom goes like "Ye gurgaon wali hi achhi hai , yhi karle join" .
How does our mom tell people/Relatives, What we do?Expectation:"He was working as software developer in TCS, then moved to Deloitte, and now moving to Amazon as senior developer."Reality: "Phele pune me kahi tha, fir Banglore gaya, ab Hyderabad me kahi join kar rha hai."#linkedin #linkedinglobal #lifeexperience #success #growbetter #humorP.S.: Mummy doesn't care about company names🤪
That is absolutely true ! whenever they go down, no one even thinks that there might be a problem at the Facebook end ! Instead of that people start doubting their internet service provider, restarting their devices and a lot of other stuff I have seen some people even uninstalling their whatsapp application and installing it again 😅😅#facebook #whatsapp #instagram

No matter how many times I have been on stage in front of hundreds of people, gave a number of talks , hosted a lot of events but I still can't sleep when I know that Tomorrow morning I have to address 100+ people and give a talk about something. It's definitely not out of any kind of anxiety or fear , it's the excitement of being there once again and have an interaction with the people sitting in front of me . It's the excitement that's keeps us going and gives us energy to go through the presentation 100 times at 3 in the night and make changes every single time we through. I guess excitement is one of the short term force which you keeps you going anything tirelessly ! p.s - i am writing this at almost 5 in the morning and have a presentation in 3  hours 😅 #energy #events #sleep #people #encouragement #excitement
If anyone wants to learn JAVA Language then Navin Reddy has made an awesome video for you . Two years back when I started learning JAVA  it was an Alien language to me and then I found a guy saying "Hello Aliens " . After that point I learnt JAVA day in day out and became popular as "The JAVA Guy" in college. Now after two years when I sat to Revise all the concepts thoroughly I thought of just sharing this amazing resource with you allThank You so Much Navin Reddy ❤✨And here is the link to the video  https://lnkd.in/e-7nYMAn#java #learning #language #thankyou #coding #tutorials #programming #developer

I believe, as a common courtesy, all job applicants deserve a response.Even more so if a person has interviewed as you can provide that candidate with valuable feedback as to why they weren't chosen.We live in a culture where ghosting is commonplace and employers can do better.
You can be a dev, you can be a competitive programmer. You can be anyone. But on a public platform if you are attacking most* of the entire community, have the courage to read the counter points. Blocking the profile because the comment got 70ish likes in 10 minutes is something which people with “God complex” do. Have you ever heard a CP guy saying GSOC is sh**. You will not, because we respect every field. Every field has its own advantages/disadvantages. You also need to accept this. Its a good thing to spread awareness on things you do best. But spreading awareness != taking down other field always. Been noticing this from long. Next time you wanting to put your perception on socials, only put if you are willing to hear others and not run away by blocking or deleting every other comment which speaks opposite to your views.#striver
I have heard that CRED sends out Macbook to new hires along with the offer letter. According to Kunal Shah they can return the macbook if they do not accept the offer letter. This gesture makes people trust the company and the process far more than some BMW bikes and Dubai rewards gigs #BharatPe #Hiring #Greed Not sure about the info but every single person almost 99% to whom the macbook had been sent with the offer letter ended up joining Cred with 0% lost laptops. This is how a culture of loyalty and trust is built.  BharatPe #culture #people #job #dubai #vacation #bmw #bike #cred #macbook
This is just awesome... A great example of what technology and innovation can really do.

Hello everyone, Interns in the corporate field have been exploited by organizations time and again. It is normal for interns to make huge deliverables at a small or no compensation.I started interning with White Thoughts & Branding in April 2020, at the time I was in my first year of graduation.I worked with the organization for 2 months, made sure I delivered all my tasks in time and worked with my utmost dedication. I was promised a stipend of 9000 INR and a certificate on completion of my internship. When I asked for the same after completion, it was delayed for a few weeks until the employers stopped responding to me altogether. I did not open up for long because I was only a fresher and was not aware of the actions I could take.   But LinkedIn in itself is a very powerful platform to promote a healthy work environment. And I want to use it to raise my voice against the unjust behaviour meted with me and encourage other freshers like me who may have been done wrong. Please protect your rights as an employee and support people who may have befallen to such unfortunate situations. I am attaching a copy of my offer letter from White Thoughts & Branding and screenshots of messages where I asked my seniors for my stipend and certificate but I received no response. #linkedin #internship #fraudprevention #freshers #awarness

Hey Everyone !! I trust you all are doing absolutely great and staying at home !! . When this lock down happened i thought it would be the most chilled out period of my life , of course i made a list of what all i have to learn in this lock down . As i proceeded with the things , i found out that i am equally busy  as i were before but yes this period has given me an opportunity to boost a lot things  , be it my health , my skills , my mental health and a lot more things. A lot of things were happening since a last few weeks and was very busy to post about any of them . Now i will be posting about everything that happened in last few weeks , be it my learnings , achievements , experiences etc . Starting with the NPTEL course i enrolled somewhere in or around January  . It was about "Managing change in organisations " . This course gave an deep insight about what all changes happen in organisations , how to handle those changes and how to maintain an smooth environment in an organization . I learned a lot of things which will definitely help me in future . #lockdown #learnings #nptel #managing_change #organization #courses

Took a Introductory session on Web Security on 28th August , 2019 in Sharda University . It was amazing , students were very much interested to know how to start with doing penetration testing of Web applications. Initially told them about the basic concepts of web application and then dived into some of the most prevalent vulnerabilities. At the end , students were full of question about there privacy and how to safeguard their privacy on internet . Overall it was a very interactive  session and me personally enjoyed very much interacting with the students ..#cybersecurity #hacking #privacy #infosec #informationsecurity #webapplication #pentesting #security #talks
