"That is how you talk to clients? NO CORPORATE LINGO AND SO OPEN?" this was a reaction I got from one team member on a recent client call. Got me thinking...I think this is how things should be. I genuinely dislike using a political tone. And too many diplomatic words.Keeping things real - that is way better! Being sincere, upfront and to the point. This gets results faster.Of course in most corporations the tone is political. And diplomatic. But my experience is that by us leading with authenticity and openness, that gets the other person to open up fast.And speeds things up in solving issues.And if it doesn't, well then not sure anybody can help without knowing the true issue. So maybe best not to engage further.Thoughts?#keepitreal #communication

STOP STALKING PEOPLE! Build connections instead!There was a statistic that more than 90% of the people on LinkedIn only read stuff. They never really engage! That to me is a waste. #linkedin is an amazing platform to build connections.For that you need to comment...Engage with others...Share your opinion... Ask for feedback...Yes most of us are afraid of looking stupid.But you cant look stupid sharing things you care about. Or things that help others.So just do it!Thoughts?#buildingconnections

These are the platforms that have blocked President Trump in last days.  Cannot help asking:1. If indeed he breached the platforms' terms of use, should this not have been done earlier? (it is not like his social media sharing has changed drastically only in the last days)2. If he didn't breach the terms, why ban him?beyond this incident- social media platforms need to be held accountable somehow of misinformation/lies/fake news spread though their platform.Thoughts?
Leaving salary aside, which of the below is THE MOST important to you in choosing a job?(I know all are important - but there is always ONE which matters most!)#career

"Aren't you afraid you will lose clients by being too upfront?" Got asked this question - and will admit for a long time i struggled with this...But now, the answer is: NOT AT ALL! Because if somebody doesn't like our style at Alcott Global, well, there are many other companies they can work with.And for us, it is easiest to work with like-minded people.So i actually find that being AUTHENTIC and UPFRONT saves everyone's time. And is a natural filter to people that want to work with us. Versus people who don't.Your thoughts?#executivesearch #leadersinsupplychain #futuresupplychain #supplychain #alcottglobal

RANT ALERT: have you seen people posting things like - "humbled to have won first prize...", "humbled to win this award...", "humbled to get this certificate..." ?For me, "humbled" is the wrong word.Happy, proud, excited, delighted...those would more sincerely describe winning to me.Moreover, don't know about you, but I have never gotten more humble by winning something.I got humbled when I lost.When things did not go my way.When I realised I am not as good as I thought. And that I have a lot more to learn.Your thoughts?

Amazon gets a lot of credit for their logistics...but to me the best in the world are Alibaba Group and JD.COM. Thoughts?..."a typical, 1 kg package can be sent anywhere in China within 24 hours for around 30 cents. The goal is to deliver it anywhere in the world within 72 hours for $3. (Currently, a DHL envelope under 0.5 kg from Shanghai to London costs around $100 and takes typically 5 days.)" #logistics #supplychain #leadersinsupplychain #futuresupplychain

"How can I FUTURE PROOF my career?"My first reply to that question is NOT learn more skills. NOR is it take more courses.It is: BUILD A LONG TERM NETWORK!Of course skills matter and constantly learning is a must.But it is network and relationships that matter more in the long run. Or at least that is my experience.Your network is your networth!Thoughts? Comment below. #career #supplychain #leadership #executivesearch

I am not a pessimist, but good to be realistic that we have a way to go on the path to recovery (US$3.5 billion have been lost so far in working hours):via Ewa Staworzynska from International Labour Organization "▪️ Global working time lost in Q2 of 2020 was 17.3%, equivalent to 495 million full time jobs.*▪️ ​Global labour income is estimated to have declined by 10.7%, or US$ 3.5 trillion, in Q1-3 of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019.▪️ The biggest drop in labour income has occurred in lower-middle income countries, where the labour income losses reached 15.1%, with the Americas the hardest hit region at 12.1%.▪️ Global working-hour losses are now projected to amount to 8.6 per cent in Q4 of 2020, which corresponds to the equivalent of 245 million full time jobs.*▪️ The estimated fiscal stimulus gap is around US$982 billion in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (US$45 billion and US$937 billion, respectively).Full report available here: https://lnkd.in/di4erJ2*Compared to Q4 of 2019."

How fast did you find yours?)#NewPerspectives

DECOUPLING and RESHORING -Today we are joined by Rosemary Coates from Reshoring Institute who shared on:What is the current status of a "#decoupling" process?  Is change happening now, in 6 months, or part of a much longer-term plan?  Are some industries going to #restore faster than others? which ones?#Reshoring in the age of coronavirus: what are some of the #hurdles in #leaving #China?What does the supply chain look like in 5 years?  (Could include thoughts on how much is made in China for China, how much is exported from China to the US or the world, how much is manufactured outside of China for China and for the US market)If not the US or China, then where?  Are we more/less likely to see these "third country" manufacturing locations thrive in the coming years?Can you share with us some recent #casestudies that you have been involved in restoring to the USA? how did it go?Also #Manufacturing #Jobs From Reshoring Will Be Totally different, how to do you see the skillsets needed in advanced economies like US?

The most comprehensive list of the #WarehouseAutomation Market.The appetite for #automation has increased frantically over the last 6 months - my only question is whether it is only worth USD30 billion? It seems worth a lot more to me.Since companies across industries are investing heavily in this, from retail, ecommerce, logistics to fmcg, etc.
Reading "COVID19: the great reset" - written by Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum and Thierry Malleret, co-founder of the Monthly Barometer - the book highlights how the pandemic has disrupted our social and economic systems, and what changes will be needed (also addresses how #supplychains will be impacted)You can find the book on Amazon. https://lnkd.in/gZHuHqqPS.

In a time when often we take political correctness too far, good to see an honest coffee add. Agree?
#Singapore - a country that keeps re-inventing itself. It is incredible to see the transformation in under 20 years.Whilst COVID19 has certainly brought a new type of challenge, I for one am sure that #Singapore will find a way forward. And these two quotes say it best from Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore:“Change is the very essence of life. The moment we cease to change, to be able to adapt, to adjust, to respond effectively to new situations, then we have begun to die.”“Rest on laurels? I wish I could do that. No, you rest when you’re dead”.
This week we will be starting our #TalentSharing sessions - on LINKEDIN LIVE - Topic of this week: "LinkedIn - how to use it for job search, networking and finding candidates" Thursday, 27th August, 8pm Singapore/HK/Shanghai time - 2pm CET - 8am ESTComment below with your questions and will try to address it.

#sundayfun - Any resemblance with reality is purely accidental. Any other role missing in this organisational chart?...
#GlobalTrade numbers as released by   WTO - it does not look encouraging...Not wanting to sound pessimistic, my sense is we will experience a significant crash/continued decline before the sustained recovery happens.Your take?
Mental Health - no idea if LinkedIn is the medium to share about this. But I know for a fact many professionals and executives struggle with itSo wanted to share my own story. I have struggled with seasonal mood swings for 15 years. The high side would be very productive. But the low side would get me depressed with no reason. And it could last for months.I did go to a psychiatrist in the second year it happened and was diagnosed with cyclothymia (mild form of bipolar) and given medicine. But I never took the medicine. I thought I am weak if I did it. Fast forward 10 years and many months of depression episodes, my wife convinced me to see a psychiatrist again. Same assessment.This time have been taking medication for mood stabilizing for 3 years now - and so far no other depression episode.Thought to share because we definitely have a stigma around Mental Health issues. This post alone took me one year in thinking whether to do it or not.If we break our leg, there is no stigma to share about it. And go to a specialist to fix it.But, if we are depressed, quite a few of us would say it is not ok to share. Or go to a specialist to fix it.This is an issue affecting many professions. Sharing as we have solutions for it. And hopefully it helps some of you who read this.
Can someone explain how this is possible? Rewarding executives for getting companies bankrupt by giving them hefty bonuses. Makes no sense to me. How boards approve of this is mind boggling...Thoughts?

Recently saw a list #innovative companies - Apple was top of the list.To me it simply doesn't add up - I fail to see what Apple has brought as significant breakthrough innovations after Steve Jobs passed away.What this article says makes a lot more sense - but I would not put Microsoft in the same bucket. Satya Nadella has brought a fresh new way of doing things!Your take? Am I missing something?

In a recent sharing i had with one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors, their view was that there is a need of 50 to 100 times more capacity to properly distribute the vaccine once it is ready - that is one huge challenge!(Also bearing in mind the temperature and quality control measure that need to be in place - they are totally different level to carrying PPE)Your take?Thanks to Neel Jones Shah Frederic GOMER Peter van Minderhout Alessandro Pasetti for the article sharing
Foxconn seems to be clear on their direction...and it moving more and more out of #China
A lot of times interviews end up being interrogations. Interviewers drilling candidates with questions. This SHOULD NOT be the case! Interviews are two way streets. Candidates  are also interviewing the company/hiring manager to make sure it is a fit. Hence they need to go prepared with good questions to ask.Here are some of my key questions to ask in an interview:1. What are the main challenges you are faced with that this role needs to address?2. How will you measure success of the role in 6, 12 months, 24 months?3. What are the career progression opportunities in the role?4. What do you like about your job? And how about what do you like about working for the company?(The last thing you want is a disengaged boss - if you only get a politically correct and fluffy answer to this - for me is a big red flag. Someone who doesn't enjoy what they do won't be fun to work for)Plus, if the role is not confidential and this is possible - I would also ask to walk around the office to get a "feel" for the culture.Any other question you would ask?
We are working with one of the top Global SHIPPING Organisations to identify a Head of Asia Pacific Government Relations (as well as to act as Senior Representative APAC). The ideal candidate comes with at least 20 years of experience on the shipping/container liner side across the Asia Pacific.

Will we ever get there?- How to break down the journey toward internal alignment and synchronization of data, systems and processes across multiple countries, in order to get the right data and synchronization?- What is your experience with visibility software and how does it improve the data quality and availability? How can data be turned in actionable insights? What are the key lessons learnt?- Many organisations still operate on Excel and legacy non-integrated systems that make visibility impossible.

"How can you possibly run an executive search practice and do a global supply chain summit, a podcast and all the rest???"The question I got recently - fair to ask I think so here is my attempt to answer...In my mind, they are all complimentary to one another...and are interconnected...and help me get to know many more people & acquire much more industry knowledge & get inside information of what is going on ... than doing only one of them only!And key to share - I could never do all of these things by myself! The reason why WE (and here I will focus on the WE = Alcott Global team) manage to do it all is because:1. the TEAM: I am blessed with an incredible team at Alcott Global of super smart and talented individuals - I am most of the time only the face of the many many many things happening in the background that they do incredibly well.Without the team, I would not be able to do much2. The COMMUNITY - all of you that follow us...share our content...forward our jobs and summit and tell others...give us feedback and help us stay relevant and even become more relevant.Again, without all of you, we would not be able to do it!!Hope this helps somewhat with how we manage to do it...And very grateful to all of you who helped us so far and continue to do so!

Recently had an argument with someone on LinkedIn. Who found one of my posts to be not in tune with his impression of me.It happens. I tried to explain to him where I was coming from.He still argued I should not have posted it. And that is not alligned to my brand.That to me was a big NO! enough! I respect other people views. But not to the point of censoring myself to fit their impression of myself. I dont really need or want to fit other people views.Because when I post things:1. It is only my point of view (disclaimer, i dont think I am all knowing and I have changed some of my views over time)2. I am doing it being authentic and real to myself (not to other people view of myself - that I cant control. Nor do I try to match)Thought to share...because a lot of us are in the same situation.We hold back for fear of what others will think of us.Well...dont!!Let's be ourselves...Everyone else is taken!And only by being authentic we are actually unique!So keep posting your opinions peeps!Thoughts?

#funny but #notfunny - don't use Covid19 (or any other reason) to justify not paying people what they are worth.Short term maybe you save some money.Long term you will lose for sure!

#funny and #true - Also the reason why #StartUps will continue to disrupt #MNCs - because they are willing to do things first. And not wait until it has been done by somebody else.If we look at Kodak, Blockbuster, Nokia, etc - they had all they needed to innovate. But they didnt.Thoughts?

Donald Trump: "These stupid supply chain that are all over the world, we have a supply chain where they're made in all different parts of the world and one little piece of the world goes bad and the whole thing is messed up. I said we shouldn't have supply chains. We should have them all in the United States. We have the companies to do it. And if we don't, we can do that."Firstly, i am 100% sure he doesn't understand supply chain.Secondly, how exactly would it work to have everything made in USA? Or any other one country for that matter? (remember an estimate that said that with all parts made in USA an iPhone would cost USD 2000 so double of today price)Thoughts?#supplychains #supplychainresilience #scm

Taking the pledge to CANCEL the MANEL!A bit of context ...I always thought of myself as being open minded.And i have actively advocated for diversity. Both of gender, as well as age, race, etcBut, two days ago we put out a report. Of skills needed in supply chain. Where we quoted 9 experts.And all 9 were male!I did notice it. But that didn't stop me from publishing it.Was called on it - and only then the full reality kicked in my brain. Maybe I am not that open-minded after all! Otherwise I would not have published it.And then I learnt about the MANEL.Manel = a speaker panel made up only of men Upon thinking, I realised I had been on a few Manels just in the last 12 months. (and just on reading my Linkedin fee these last 2 days - i saw at least 4 MANELS of ONLINE events)So, on top of becoming aware of my own unconscious biases...Here is my action pledge - I won't take part in any MANEL from now on!Anyone else who wants to join?

50,000+ friends and followers on LinkedIn - how did it happen?Whilst writing this i am proud that so many people find our content relevant.And wanted to share some learnings:1. #Quality content is #key - the one that adds value to people. It is not about us, it is about the audience. Yes occasionally posting to brag and show our achievements is ok. But people follow people that bring them value. 2. #LinkedIn is an amazing platform to #build #relationships. We got new business and made new friends with people we never met. Because through content and engagement we realised we share common goals and interests. 3. It is a #longlonglong term game. Too many people (including myself) expect instant results. Just like in life - it doesnt happen like this. When you build a relationship with someone - it takes time for trust to happen. Same on social media.4. And the key one: #just #share! ... otherwise nothing happens! Raise the flag. Stand for what you believe in.For a long time I doubted and censored myself. And did not share much (yeah, maybe hard to believe but I did) What I realised: as long as I genuinely try to add value - it doesn't matter what people think. One person benefiting is good enough.Anything I missed? Comment below.
This graph is based on an extensive study. The reality is - supply chain is key in #board rooms all over the world.

NEED YOUR FEEDBACK! - I am no financial expert - but I struggle to make sense of the stock market movements in the last few weeks. Stocks bounced back almost 20%+ and are now in technical bull market territory.All the while the economic data worldwide is pointing to a severe recession and even depression: unemployment rates, International Monetary Fund projecting -3% GDP this year, manufacturing data, blank sailing, etcMy question is, do you think:1. the market has indeed recovered and will continue to go up?2. it is just a phase before another major drop in stock prices?Comment below!#leadersinsupplychain #headhunters #executivesearch #ignite

Examples of good #LEADERSHIP behaviour in times of #Crisis- Jacinda Ardern  - Prime Minister of #NewZealand, with effective communication and measures to guide the country.Included Tooth Ferry and Eastern Bunny on Essential Workers list. And all while having a small baby girl- Leo Varadkar - Prime Minister of #Ireland - he used to be a doctor. He has resumed taking on shifts at a hospital on top of his government attributions to lend a helping hand- Erna Solberg - Prime Minister of #Norway - she went on national TV and shared with parents how to help children navigate the difficult times.

Typically I would not post political examples on #LinkedInBut this for me personally is just a big NO NO in terms of #leadership! Whether you are the #President of a country. Or the #CEO of a company.Or the #captain of a football team. Or the #manager of a work group.Or whatever leadership role.Can you ever say like a #leader: I dont take any responsability at all??? I would argue you cannot and should not. This is not leadershipThoughts?Alcott Global #leaders #leadershipdevelopment #leadershipinaction
The main issue with #Covid-19 - it is super contagious! Have a look of how one patient infected 8 others on a bus.This is not like a flu - it is more like 8 months of flu cases happening in 4 weeks - it basically swamps the hospitals and healthcare system. Creating chaos.So let's all do out part- follow World Health Organization - wash hands- avoid crowds- stay home if sickStay safe everyone! #globalcrisis #crisis #coronavirus #supplychains Alcott Global

With the situation rapidly escalating - I still get comments from people saying #coronavirus is like a #flu. I want to share the below statistics for a sense of proportion and urgency of taking the appropriate measures:#coronavirus is much more #contagious than the #flu (this also means the healthcare systems can very rapidly become unable to cope with the number of cases that need attending)#fatality is higher (estimated 20 times higher)What we can all do is:- follow World Health Organization and the #Governtments advice- seek medical attention fast if unwell- wash hands often and avoid touching our faceI am hopeful the situation is due to get better in next 4 to 8 weeks if we all do out part.Alcott Global #crisis #executivesearch #leadershipincrisis

#Wuhan crisis and #racism - as the crisis unfolds, quite some negative comments have come up in the social media against China and the Chinese nationals. For different reasons that I would rather not go into.BUT...at the end of the day...this is a CRISIS SITUATION. Directly affecting 1.5 billion people!There have been many different recent other crises: Australian fires, different terrorist attacks, natural disasters, etc. Where people all over the world showed compassion and came together to support the affected communities.I do believe the same applies now!The people of Wuhan and Hubei province are doing their best to go through this. So do the people in China in general.As HUMAN beings - regardless of political views and whatever else - I think we should help in whichever way we can. This could have happened in another country as well.And the way the people of China are responding is quite incredible. So let's hope scientists find a cure for this soon. And if we can, help those in need!#WuhanStrong #staystrong #thistooshallpass

Will the #CoronaVirus #pandemic lead to a  #global #recession?SARS epidemic in 2002-2003 impacted China GDP by approx 1%.

And the country’s 1.3 billion population provides the largest market in the world for several categories of consumer goods—automobiles, spirits, luxury goods."All this will be on lockdown in the next weeks.On top, manufacturing put on hold - supply chain disruptions and many local SMEs being impacted What is your take?Alcott Global #alcottglobal #china #crisis

During a recent interview was asked HOW CAN LEADERS HOLD ON TO THEIR TOP TALENT?"I guess, this firstly boils down to the fundaments of leadership. People follow leaders who are good human beings. Leaders who listen, give good feedback, and say “thank you”. Leaders who take the time to understand each team memberAnd pull teams together to work on a shared goal. Employees crave authentic leadership. Leaders need to be willing to speak the truth and show vulnerability. Don’t try to be politically correct all the time.BE REAL!"What would you add?

How to #attract #talent to #SCM worldWe need more authentic leaders from the industry to share stories about the good work done.

A bit unexpected for me to see #Taiwan saw the most #trade growth with USA due to the #tradewar in the first half of the year.

"How to align both my company brand and my own personal brand when I post?""I don't want to brag about things we do and can't be posting every day pictures of visiting a factory or warehouse""How to share in order to make it interesting and relevant for people?"These are just some of the key questions we discussed in our supply chain executive roundtable which was excellently moderated by Yasmine Khater (many many thanks!)And some of the key conclusions:- most executives find it hard to share things given all the considerations that need to be taken into account (reputation of the company, potential bad feedback, etc) - but it boils down to the PURPOSE of each individual. As social media is an incredibly powerful tool to share information, case studies and build relationships- ultimately it is about being AUTHENTIC and sharing who you are (not having the MK or PR department do it for you and then it becomes fake)- everyone committed to share more and not overthink too muchThanks for all who participated and follow them all as they are great people!Sam Eid Damien Dhellemmes Fabrice THOMAS Thomas Mascali Gaetano Seminario Satyaki Banerjee Tim Wickmann Ilkka Tales, Global Growth Accelerator Eric van Steen Alan Zeller

This is not #Linkedin material but will share because it is general #safety material. And can potentially help others.Yesterday was crossing on the side walk,  in front of the truck carrying the crane.Literally 5 seconds after I crossed it, the truck accidentally went into gear and rolled onto the street full length. The driver tried to jump in and stop it but was too late. And he got slightly injured. The truck colliding with the rail.Luckily there was no oncoming cars My two cent sharing:- always triple check before crossing in front of any heavy vehicle- respect project logistics and the people behind it as they have a dangerous jobStay safe everyone!

Saw this quote by the founder of Lean and Kaizen manufacturing concepts - "The basis of the Toyota production system is the total elimination of waste. Initially it meant waste surfacing in the manufacturing processes. After trying to identify and eliminate every type of waste, we concluded that REAL WASTE was MAKING PRODUCTS THAT DONT SELL. This waste is the most crucial because it is not just a loss to the company - it is a loss to society."Taichii Ohno Feb #sustainability since 1988What is your take?

What are the major challenges in #recruiting talent in #supplychain? Below some thoughts from an interview we recently did with #ContainerExchange - what do you think?"One challenge is changing the #narrative and #story line so to make it appealing for young people to join. Which is slowly changing, especially because ecommerce and startups are creating new compelling stories. But there is still a lot more that companies need to do to get the young generation to join them.Secondly, would say right now we are seeing a #convergence of #digital skills into every industry – which means that there is a high demand for this type of skills. And the battle for talent has never been tougher. It also means you have to compete with likes of Google and Facebook – as skills like machine learning or AI or automation are needed everywhere. So, it is tough!"

Story of why the industry needs change...in #Barcelona for #Gartner event and was helping a friend to get his package sent by one Express provider. (Let's not name them!) The package was supposed to arrive today at 12pm (noon in Barcelona). At 5pm no sign of it. I go with him to check with the Express provider - at the warehouse (30 min away from the city!) we are told that no chance to get it today. Maybe tomorrow (but tomorrow he needs it for the conference!)He calls the customer service- they tell him to call the manager of the warehouse. 1 hour later amid bunch of papers exchanged over the desk and some excel files...they somehow manage to find it.We get the package, spend 20 min to get a cab back and there go a couple of hours of the day. When the package should have been delivered at 12.On the bright side...this is why change is inevitable!! #globallogistics #express #freightforwarders #transportlogistic #barcelona

An amazing achievement by the Liverpool team - and just want to share a few thoughts on the coach, Juergen Klopp. As I think every CEO can learn from what he achieved at Liverpool:- he pulled the team together and their improvement from last year has been incredible- he lost 6 previous finals as a coach...Liverpool lost the premier league...and still he managed to instill in himself and the team the belief to keep fighting and never give up- he is by far the most popular coach on social media with an incredible personal brand - he is an incredibly authentic honest and good human being (his closest rivals called him to congratulate him on the victory)And many more...Klopp...you are a hero! And of course all the great Liverpoool players who fought as lions! Congrats!
"Your idea is not original; someone has copied it already. As you're reading this post, someone in Asia is studying your product and making a better version of it.Someone is building an AI algorithm that does it faster, cheaper, better.What are you going to do? - Compete with 5000 copycats or a new generation of AI?- Spend more money with your ad agency to tell the world why YOU are better?It's futile.Do what the copiers can't do. - They can copy your product, but not your service- They can copy your brand, but not your experience- Their AI can write a book, but it can't tell a story- Their chatbot can ask, "how can I help?" but it can't say, "I'm sorry" In the age of the machine, be MORE HUMAN.Nothing else is worth fighting for."Well said Graham Brown#weekendthoughs #humafirst #authenticity

Time to announce my next destination...But before that...some quick sharing about my last years as a headhunter...Firstly, I never intended to become a headhunter. Nor did I ever intend to be so close to the supply chain field!But THE key ingredient that made this journey so rewarding were the PEOPLE. The Supply Chain Community!Clients, candidates and connections all over the world that gave me good feedback and kept me going!And throughout all this journey many of these people became close friends! Which ultimately for me is the BEST thing!And also I strongly believe that the industry is at a point of transformation, inflection and change! So super interesting times!Hence...today I am excited to say that I plan to continue to play a small part in connecting the supply chain community in Asia (and soon globally), by launching Alcott Global: https://lnkd.in/fsBnn-FAlcott Global will ONLY focus on the SUPPLY CHAIN domain.

Professor Annie Koh on GRAY HAIR and  Education in #Logistics and #SupplyChain: “ Who said learning can only take place in the classroom? Learning can take place outside the classroom as well. Students are working on projects in companies. In the process of doing, they are learning. And of course in that process you are also coaching them. So you have a chance to identify the #TALENT that fits your culture, or has the right competencies and entrepreneurial spirit depending on your organisation’s value chain stage. So if you are a young #startup, you definitely could do with a lot of young talent,  if you are  at a steady growth stage,  but you still need your eyes to come in, you can interact with them. Many in the #maritime and logistics actually have gray hair or no hair. They have succession challenges. So shouldn't it be your responsibility as a senior executive to also have a pipeline of next generation people? The more I learn about shipping, logistics and supply chain, the more I think it's an exciting area! And this can be a great career pathway. So I am encouraging young talent to focus and learn more about it!”Listen to the PODCAST here: https://lnkd.in/fmiveNvDo you agree?

Afraid to ask for a RAISE? It is normal. Most people are. But, if you don't ask, you WON'T get in most cases!That's why you need to prepare. One of the first things you should ask - What does my boss want? How did my work help with the goals and objectives that my boss is responsible for?Start with these questions: Did your responsibilities increase? Do you bring more to the bottom line? Have a clear list of accomplishments (include numbers - always include numbers - bosses love them!) It is much easier to make a case when you have numbers to back you up when you knock on the boss's door.  Consider the timing - is this the best time you can bring it up? Did you just come back from a nice vacation in  Bali or Phuket? Maybe not the best timing for asking for a raise. Did you just close a big account?  Did you just finish a difficult project withing the deadline? Did you just make your boss look good? Better time to bring it up!Be prepared for NO! It doesn't mean no way - it means not yet. Not now. A no can give you leverage in the next negotiation meeting.What do you think?

I WANT A CHANGE! I hate my job… What should I do?I had a few calls along these lines. It is surprising how easy it is to get too emotional and make bad decisions. If you want to make a change in your career, DO YOUR #HOMEWORK! Good homework can’t be done when you are emotional. You can't think straight. So maybe first sleep on it. Move away from the tension and plan your next move. Step one:Are you sure your #job sucks? I mean it might be that it is temporary difficult time, or you can find a different opportunity inside the organisation. If you already know that you had enough and there is no place for you there, let’s move to step number two: What do you want?Recruiters have a list of MUST HAVEs for their candidates, YOU should have the same list for  your next #opportunity. You need to have a clear list of what you want to get out of the new job AND, also very important, WHAT you WON’T accept. Never a good idea to run from a bad situation and end up in a s#%t storm. Ok, you have your list. You know the type of organisation, culture, type of boss, the scope of work, how it would play to your strengths, the salary, the career trajectory - YOU are good to GO!What’s Next? Will follow up on this..

India PM Modi shared some useful advice: "To increase your venture capital funding by 10%, tell the investors you run a “platform,” not a regular business. If you want to increase your VC funding by 20%, tell the investors that you are operating in the “fintech space.” But, if you really want the investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using “blockchain.”In this spirit (fun thought!) - Maybe we should be operating a PLATFORM driven, FINTECH LEADERSHIP company using BLOCKCHAIN technology!Open to speak to investors! #business #running #shares #howto #funding #venturecapital #recruiting #fintech #digitization #management #startups #stock #supply

Bjorn: "In many companies, supply chain is seen as the poor cousin. If sales is in the front of the front room, #supplychain is in the back of the back room. It gets even worse when you call it shipping because now people assume you’re either a truck driver or a courier.But if you can really build stories—everything is about telling stories, isn’t it? You can build stories in your #recruitment process around working globally, working across time zones, traveling, enabling global trade— let’s be honest, supply chain built globalization, not the other way around, right?You need those stories—whether that’s with videos, whether that’s with bringing people out who really have amazing learning experiences - you want to make the industry sexy - tell better stories!"

Many companies completely fail on the below - and most desperately need entrepreneurship (credits Brigette Hyacinth)"I HIRED someone who had no experience in the position we were hiring for. He had never worked in this specific job function. This guy was in the midst of switching careers but had the skillset we were looking for. I believed his entrepreneurial experience would easily transfer to corporate. In the end, he was just what our organization needed. Sadly  today, I see many qualified candidates being overlooked or eliminated, because they are not working in the same position. I wish recruiters and hiring managers would be versed in identifying transferable skills, ingenuity, drive and potential. Many people can’t fit into the narrow parameters of a linear career history in a particular field. A candidate doesn't have to tick every box in your checklist to be the "best fit". A job can be learned. By being so narrowly focused and inflexible, many companies miss out on employees who are great team players, change agents, innovators and progressive thinkers. There are so many individuals in this situation which is a complete waste of talent!"#recruiting #individualization #itmanagement #executivesearch #talent #HR #humanresources

We just don't want to move too quickly because at the end of the day we're still a relatively small company. We are growing very rapidly and we don't want to extend ourselves too thin. At the expense of not delivering the type of #quality that we have built our #brand around. So I'll share an anecdote. Facebook had a saying a which was: "move fast and break things" - alluded to just test to try stuff and if you make mistakes, you know, fail fast, learn and keep going. Well our version of that and actually have #posters on our wall is: "Move fast and don't break things!"

Sabine Mueller #CEO #DHL Consulting, on #DIVERSITY:  "It's a long journey. And I'm talking about GENDER diversity because one of the first issues is that when we talk about diversity, we tend to make it very broad. Some say: diversity for us is gender, age, nationalities, background. That's true. That's diversity. However, the bigger and more complicated you make it, more difficult it is to measure it and improve it. I talk about gender diversity in this case. That's still the biggest problem where we really have to improve. The problem starts when management doesn't take it serious enough.We talked about all the targets to digitize, to improve margins and so on. There's so much pressure to deliver on these targets. DIVERSITY is something we always treat as SECOND PRIORITY. We need to do it, but currently we don't have time. If we don't change this, it will be really difficult to make a difference. If we don't hold our management accountable and say let us measure improvements or  have a KPI measuring it. It will not happen."How does your organisations MEASURE DIVERSITY?

Many thanks for all the good words to all our listeners over time!#leadersinsupplychain #podcast #supplychain #leadership #industry #
"I declined the offer… I'm staying where I am. The recruiter called me and asked why? This is one of the top companies. What's the counter offer? Me: No counter offer. 1) I had 6 rounds of #interviews.2) I was grilled with questions but nobody took the time to explain what the job is like and did not even ask if I have any questions. 3) Lots of questions did not make sense - like why I am leaving my employer. I was not, your recruiter approached me and convinced me to come for your interview. Where I see myself in 5 years. They could not tell me where they see their company in 6 months. 4) The #hiring process is too long, too disorganized. 5) The offer took too long. 6) The interviewers did not compare notes because during the 6 rounds of interviews they were asking the same questions. This should not look like an interrogation. They also looked tired and stressed. If you want to hire #talent, fix your basics. Treat #candidates as people, not as applicants.Fast forward, that company is not in the top tier any more. Take hiring seriously. Those who you hire will determine your future."Great post and sharing Priya Runthala!
Happy New Lunar Year!!
Sabine Mueller #CEO #DHL consulting, advice for your career:  "You GET what you have the COURAGE to ask for!  In my case I should have told people earlier what my vision is and where I want to go. Even if it's bold. Just say I want to do this job. Yes, I'm not ready yet, but keep it in mind. I want to be a CEO over there even if it's five steps ahead. Rather than saying, Oh no, I have to go back and I have to learn more before I  say something about it. Be BOLD and ask for what you want and you will be astonished how much you will receive."

What are the most important #SKILLS from you perspective? Some of the highlights of the report:"75 million current job roles may be displaced by the shift in the division of labour between humans, machines and algorithms, while 133 million new job roles may emerge at the same time." AND "On average, employees will need 101 days of retraining and upskilling in the period up to 2022."
"I’m sorry.  The candidate just accepted an offer from another firm.What?!  You told us she loved us, that she wanted to work for us.She did.We’re #1 in our space, you said she liked that.She did.You said she liked the team, that she thought she would fit in here.She did.I don’t understand, we were thinking about making her an offer.Yes.And while you were THINKINGYour competition was ACTING.While you waited three weeks to get that last business partner to meet with her…Your competition flew her in to meet the key players and had her do a video call with the business partners who weren’t available.While you sat on the knowledge that she was interviewing elsewhere…Your competition made things happen and sped up the process.While you waited a month to get a few more people for "comparison"...Your competition recognized top talent and made the call.While you debated with HR over salary requirements and asked her for her history…They put out an offer at the top end of their range to ensure the deal was done.If you want the top talent, you need to be thoughtful, yes.But be DECISIVE!I promise you, your competition is."Credits to Tim Gerrells, II and James Crissey #business #executivesearch #recruiting #hiring #career
One of our most popular #podcast episodes was with Charles Brewer. talking about creating a strong #culture: "Traditionally, I’ve seen certain functions get more celebration than others. I think that’s wrong. I think we need to celebrate everybody’s contribution to the organization. If I’m in the warehouse, I’ll have lunch with the couriers. It’s just the way we operate. That’s the way we work. I think that makes the team bond and everyone understand we are like a family. People need to feel included and then they will give their best for the organization ” Do you agree?Here is the Episode in full: https://lnkd.in/fZ3S6tj| #leadersinsupplychainandlogistics #logistics #supplychain #executivesearch
