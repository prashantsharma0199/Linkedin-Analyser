Hey Everyone !! I trust you all are doing absolutely great and staying at home !! .

As i proceeded with the things , i found out that i am equally busy  as i were before but yes this period has given me an opportunity to boost a lot things  , be it my health , my skills , my mental health and a lot more things. A lot of things were happening since a last few weeks and was very busy to post about any of them . Now i will be posting about everything that happened in last few weeks , be it my learnings , achievements , experiences etc . Starting with the NPTEL course i enrolled somewhere in or around January  . It was about "Managing change in organisations " . This course gave an deep insight about what all changes happen in organisations , how to handle those changes and how to maintain an smooth environment in an organization . I learned a lot of things which will definitely help me in future . #lockdown #learnings #nptel #managing_change #organization #courses
