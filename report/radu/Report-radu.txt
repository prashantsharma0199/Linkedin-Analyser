"That is how you talk to clients? NO CORPORATE LINGO AND SO OPEN?" this was a reaction I got from one team member on a recent client call. Got me thinking...I think this is how things should be. I genuinely dislike using a political tone. And too many diplomatic words.Keeping things real - that is way better! Being sincere, upfront and to the point. This gets results faster.Of course in most corporations the tone is political. And diplomatic. But my experience is that by us leading with authenticity and openness, that gets the other person to open up fast.And speeds things up in solving issues.And if it doesn't, well then not sure anybody can help without knowing the true issue. So maybe best not to engage further.Thoughts?#keepitreal #communication

"Aren't you afraid you will lose clients by being too upfront?" Got asked this question - and will admit for a long time i struggled with this...But now, the answer is: NOT AT ALL! Because if somebody doesn't like our style at Alcott Global, well, there are many other companies they can work with.And for us, it is easiest to work with like-minded people.So i actually find that being AUTHENTIC and UPFRONT saves everyone's time.

Amazon gets a lot of credit for their logistics...but to me the best in the world are Alibaba Group and JD.COM. Thoughts?..."a typical, 1 kg package can be sent anywhere in China within 24 hours for around 30 cents. The goal is to deliver it anywhere in the world within 72 hours for $3. (Currently, a DHL envelope under 0.5 kg from Shanghai to London costs around $100 and takes typically 5 days.)" #logistics #supplychain #leadersinsupplychain #futuresupplychain

In a recent sharing i had with one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors, their view was that there is a need of 50 to 100 times more capacity to properly distribute the vaccine once it is ready - that is one huge challenge!(Also bearing in mind the temperature and quality control measure that need to be in place - they are totally different level to carrying PPE)Your take?Thanks to Neel Jones Shah Frederic GOMER Peter van Minderhout Alessandro Pasetti for the article sharing

A lot of times interviews end up being interrogations. Interviewers drilling candidates with questions. This SHOULD NOT be the case! Interviews are two way streets. Candidates  are also interviewing the company/hiring manager to make sure it is a fit. Hence they need to go prepared with good questions to ask.Here are some of my key questions to ask in an interview:1. What are the main challenges you are faced with that this role needs to address?2. How will you measure success of the role in 6, 12 months, 24 months?3. What are the career progression opportunities in the role?4. What do you like about your job? And how about what do you like about working for the company?(The last thing you want is a disengaged boss - if you only get a politically correct and fluffy answer to this - for me is a big red flag. Someone who doesn't enjoy what they do won't be fun to work for)Plus, if the role is not confidential and this is possible - I would also ask to walk around the office to get a "feel" for the culture.Any other question you would ask?

With the possibility of sparking a debate - would like to hear your opinion on the below. I am not really in the best position to comment, given I am obviously a guy - but I do think we need more women role models speaking up and showing the way. And doing so by speaking at summits, events etc is helping insure even more diversity.What is your take?

The main issue with #Covid-19 - it is super contagious! Have a look of how one patient infected 8 others on a bus.This is not like a flu - it is more like 8 months of flu cases happening in 4 weeks - it basically swamps the hospitals and healthcare system.

With the situation rapidly escalating - I still get comments from people saying #coronavirus is like a #flu. I want to share the below statistics for a sense of proportion and urgency of taking the appropriate measures:#coronavirus is much more #contagious than the #flu (this also means the healthcare systems can very rapidly become unable to cope with the number of cases that need attending)#fatality is higher (estimated 20 times higher)What we can all do is:- follow World Health Organization and the #Governtments advice- seek medical attention fast if unwell- wash hands often and avoid touching our faceI am hopeful the situation is due to get better in next 4 to 8 weeks if we all do out part.Alcott Global #crisis #executivesearch #leadershipincrisis

#Wuhan crisis and #racism - as the crisis unfolds, quite some negative comments have come up in the social media against China and the Chinese nationals. For different reasons that I would rather not go into.BUT...at the end of the day...this is a CRISIS SITUATION. Directly affecting 1.5 billion people!There have been many different recent other crises: Australian fires, different terrorist attacks, natural disasters, etc. Where people all over the world showed compassion and came together to support the affected communities.I do believe the same applies now!The people of Wuhan and Hubei province are doing their best to go through this. So do the people in China in general.As HUMAN beings - regardless of political views and whatever else - I think we should help in whichever way we can. This could have happened in another country as well.And the way the people of China are responding is quite incredible. So let's hope scientists find a cure for this soon. And if we can, help those in need!#WuhanStrong #staystrong #thistooshallpass

Will the #CoronaVirus #pandemic lead to a  #global #recession?SARS epidemic in 2002-2003 impacted China GDP by approx 1%. But this time seems the impact will be much larger (see TIME article in comment). "Chinese travelers are the top spenders in international tourism, making 150 million overseas trips worth $277 billion in 2018. And the country’s 1.3 billion population provides the largest market in the world for several categories of consumer goods—automobiles, spirits, luxury goods."All this will be on lockdown in the next weeks.On top, manufacturing put on hold - supply chain disruptions and many local SMEs being impacted What is your take?Alcott Global #alcottglobal #china #crisis

How good are you at your job.If you want to be CFO, they think it is how good are you at accounting.Nope. It doesn't matter that much!Yes - of course you need to know the technical side of the job. That is a fundamental.But the difference between making it to C level and getting stuck on the road?It is ALL about RELATIONSHIPS.What they call in the Chinese world - “Guanxi”, personal connection.

This is not #Linkedin material but will share because it is general #safety material. And can potentially help others.Yesterday was crossing on the side walk,  in front of the truck carrying the crane.Literally 5 seconds after I crossed it, the truck accidentally went into gear and rolled onto the street full length. The driver tried to jump in and stop it but was too late. And he got slightly injured. The truck colliding with the rail.Luckily there was no oncoming cars My two cent sharing:- always triple check before crossing in front of any heavy vehicle- respect project logistics and the people behind it as they have a dangerous jobStay safe everyone!

Story of why the industry needs change...in #Barcelona for #Gartner event and was helping a friend to get his package sent by one Express provider. (Let's not name them!) The package was supposed to arrive today at 12pm (noon in Barcelona). At 5pm no sign of it. I go with him to check with the Express provider - at the warehouse (30 min away from the city!) we are told that no chance to get it today. Maybe tomorrow (but tomorrow he needs it for the conference!)He calls the customer service- they tell him to call the manager of the warehouse. 1 hour later amid bunch of papers exchanged over the desk and some excel files...they somehow manage to find it.We get the package, spend 20 min to get a cab back and there go a couple of hours of the day. When the package should have been delivered at 12.On the bright side...this is why change is inevitable!! #globallogistics #express #freightforwarders #transportlogistic #barcelona

An amazing achievement by the Liverpool team - and just want to share a few thoughts on the coach, Juergen Klopp. As I think every CEO can learn from what he achieved at Liverpool:- he pulled the team together and their improvement from last year has been incredible- he lost 6 previous finals as a coach...Liverpool lost the premier league...and still he managed to instill in himself and the team the belief to keep fighting and never give up- he is by far the most popular coach on social media with an incredible personal brand - he is an incredibly authentic honest and good human being (his closest rivals called him to congratulate him on the victory)And many more...Klopp...you are a hero! And of course all the great Liverpoool players who fought as lions! Congrats!

Chris tried distributing addresses and GPS coordinates for years but both failed him on numerous occasions. He was certain there was a better way: what3words was born.What3words now counts 103 people in its offices in London, Mongolia, South Africa, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia.

Time to announce my next destination...But before that...some quick sharing about my last years as a headhunter...Firstly, I never intended to become a headhunter. Nor did I ever intend to be so close to the supply chain field!But THE key ingredient that made this journey so rewarding were the PEOPLE. The Supply Chain Community!Clients, candidates and connections all over the world that gave me good feedback and kept me going!And throughout all this journey many of these people became close friends! Which ultimately for me is the BEST thing!And also I strongly believe that the industry is at a point of transformation, inflection and change! So super interesting times!Hence...today I am excited to say that I plan to continue to play a small part in connecting the supply chain community in Asia (and soon globally), by launching Alcott Global: https://lnkd.in/fsBnn-FAlcott Global will ONLY focus on the SUPPLY CHAIN domain. Together with a network of Partner Organisations.With 3 Core services:Candidate - Executive search, talent developmentConsulting - Supply chain transformationContent - Podcast, Videos, and some new materials soon!Subscribe to our Newsletter (on the website)And keep giving us your feedback and comments!

Throwback to our PODCAST with @Bjorn Vang Jensen Global Head of Logistics at Electrolux where we talked about the importance of #storytelling to attract #talent to the industry. Bjorn: "In many companies, supply chain is seen as the poor cousin. If sales is in the front of the front room, #supplychain is in the back of the back room. It gets even worse when you call it shipping because now people assume you’re either a truck driver or a courier.But if you can really build stories—everything is about telling stories, isn’t it? You can build stories in your #recruitment process around working globally, working across time zones, traveling, enabling global trade— let’s be honest, supply chain built globalization, not the other way around, right?You need those stories—whether that’s with videos, whether that’s with bringing people out who really have amazing learning experiences - you want to make the industry sexy - tell better stories!"
